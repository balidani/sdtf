   The FLP impossibility states that no deterministic algorithm 
   can solve consensus in an asynchronous system where at least one 
   process can crash. To circumvent this, we can relax the conditions 
   and make a probabilistic algorithm for consensus. This report will 
   give details on our implementation of Randomized Consensus.
